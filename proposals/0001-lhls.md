# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Low-latency HLS (LHLS) proposes to reduce the latency from the edge of a live stream. Hls.js incurs significant latency penalties from it's current architecture; and also incurs another penalty from the current method of delivering segments over HTTP. This RFC proposes modifications to Hls.js's architecture to support progressive downloading, parsing, and buffering of media segments. This proposal also aims to gain consensus on how transcoders shall signal and deliver LHLS streams to Hls.js so as to reduce latency.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The current latency between capture and playback ("glass to glass") is prohibitive for live interactivity, and provides a poor experience for time-sensitive live events (such as sports). The introduction of low-latency streaming via HTTP in Hls.js would allow developers to build a cost-effective solution on top of a free, open, and proven client.

Furthermore, the introduction of a progressive streaming pipeline in Hls.js would improve performance not only for live but for VOD. Progressively buffering segments allows Hls.js to reduce it's TTFF (time to first frame), and by the same token reduce the rebuffering time caused by network instability.

# Guide-Level Explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

 LHLS relies on the following principles:
  1. HLS segments can be described as a set of many smaller segments - each segment contains a number of GOPs (group of pictures), and each GOP can be independently transmuxed.
  2. HTTP chunked transfer encoding allows a client to maintain a persistent connection with a transcoder
  3. Transcoders can emit segment chunks as they're being transcoded
  
  Together these principles form the basis for our solution. 
  
  
  This RFC proposes changes to the top-level API of Hls.js; and also organizes the sub-subystem RFCs broken out from the main story. Please see the sections below for links to the sub-system RFCs.


# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This section details how Hls.js interprets a low-latency manifest. Developers wishing to use LHLS must adhere to the conventions laid out within this section. "The client" here refers to Hls.js but is worded so that any MSE-based player may fulfill the same requirements.

#### Activating LHLS
LHLS shall be activated through inclusion of a custom metadata tag in the master manifest: `EXT-X-LOWLATENCY`. This tag shall apply to every rendition within the stream, and should be included only once per master manifest.

#### Segments Advertising

The manifest may advertise all segments for the live period. The server must append to each segment response the `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` header. The server should maintain the persistent HTTP connection long enough for a client to receive the entire segment - at a minimum, this should be no less than the time from when the segment was first advertised to the time it has finished transcoding. The client must not expect each segment to be available for immediate download. The client must not be expected to extrapolate segment URLs based on a regular scheme.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- This feature will require significant codebase changes and will probably introduce regressions.
- The proposed changes may make the codebase more complicated. Hls.js has an event-based architecture, in which events follow a sequential pattern (e.g. LOADING -> LOADED -> PARSED -> BUFFERED). LHLS will require events to be fired out of regular order (e.g. LOADING -> LOADING -> LOADED -> LOADING -> PARSED -> LOADED). A poor implementation may make codebase maintenance more difficult.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

#### The choice of HTTP
HTTP low-latency streaming (as opposed to alternative protocols like WebRTC) allows developers to leverage existing HTTP video delivery infrastructure. It is also more straigtforward to implement in Hls.js itself.

#### What is the cost of not doing this?
Low-latency streaming is becoming increasingly desired. Larger companies such as Akamai, Wowza, and Periscope offer low-latency streaming solutions. However, these solutions are not free or open. Not implementing this feature in Hls.js would make it more difficult for all video developers to access an easy and effective LHLS solution; if LHLS becomes a basic feature in the future, not having a FOSS solution will drive people towards a closed solutioni. Furthermore, developing LHLS in the open allows everyone to participate in its development.

# Supported Environments
[supported-environments]: #supported-environments

Only browsers which support the Fetch API with streaming body responses are able to support LHLS. This includes:

- Chrome >= 63
- Edge >= 16
- Safari >= 11.1
- Firefox >= 57 (only behind a flag)
