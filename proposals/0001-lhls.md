# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Low-latency HLS (LHLS) proposes to reduce the latency from the edge of a live stream. Hls.js incurs significant latency penalties from it's current architecture; and also incurs another penalty from the current method of delivering segments over HTTP. This RFC proposes modofications to Hls.js's architecture to support progressive downloading, parsing, and buffering of media segments. This proposal also aims to gain consensus on how transcoders shall signal and deliver LHLS streams to Hls.js so as to reduce latency.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

The current latency between capture and playback ("glass to glass") is prohibitive for live interactivity, and provides a poor experience for time-sensitive live events (such as sports). The introduction of low-latency streaming via HTTP in Hls.js would allow developers to build a cost-effective solution on top of a free, open, and proven client.

Furthermore, the introduction of a progressive streaming pipeline in Hls.js would improve performance not only for live but for VOD. Progressively buffering segments allows Hls.js to reduce it's TTFF (time to first frame), and by the same token reduce the rebuffering time caused by network instability.

# Guide-Level Explanation
[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

 LHLS relies on the principle that HLS segments can be described as a set of many smaller segments - each segment contains a number of samples, and each sample can be independently transmuxed. Hls.js consists of two systems which enable LHLS: the progressive streaming engine, and the advanced segment downloader.

### Progressive Streaming Engine

At a high level, Hls.js performs four distinct steps: segment download, demux, remux, and append. The progressive streaming engine is responsible for pushing partial segments through this transmuxing pipeline so that it may be buffered in smaller pieces.

### Advanced Segment Downloader

Low-latency transcoding pipelines advertise segments in their manifest before that segment is actually transcoded. Using chunked transfer encoding, Hls.js will open an HTTP connection to each segment within the manifest. The transcoder will push partial segments as they're being processed down this connection; when received, Hls.js pushes and each partial segment through the progressive streaming engine so that it may be immediately buffered.


### LHLS Activation
To enable low-latency streaming, the master manifest must contain the `EXT-X-PROGRESSIVE` metadata tag.


### Adaptive Bitrate
To be completed later.


# Reference-level explanation
[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This RFC organizes the features which compose LHLS; please see the linked articles [here] etc.

# Drawbacks
[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

- This feature will require significant codebase changes and will probably introduce regressions.
- The proposed changes may make the codebase more complicated. Hls.js has an event-based architecture, in which events follow a sequential pattern (e.g. LOADING -> LOADED -> PARSED -> BUFFERED). LHLS will require events to be fired out of regular order (e.g. LOADING -> LOADING -> LOADED -> LOADING -> PARSED -> LOADED). A poor implementation may make codebase maintenance more difficult.

# Rationale and alternatives
[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

#### The coice of HTTP
HTTP low-latency streaming (as opposed to alternative protocols like WebRTC) allows developers to leverage existing HTTP video delivery infrastructure. It is also more straigtforward to implement in Hls.js itself.

#### What is the cost of not doing this?
Low-latency streaming is becoming increasingly desired. Larger companies such as Akamai, Wowza, and Periscope offer low-latency streaming solutions. However, these solutions are not free or open. Not implementing this feature in Hls.js would make it more difficult for all video developers to access an easy and effective LHLS solution; if LHLS becomes a basic feature in the future, not having a FOSS solution will drive people towards a closed solutioni. Furthermore, developing LHLS in the open allows everyone to participate in its development.

# Supported Environments
[supported-environments]: #supported-environments

Only browsers which support the Fetch API with streaming body responses are able to support LHLS. This includes:

- Chrome >= 63
- Edge >= 16
- Safari >= 11.1
- Firefox >= 57 (only behind a flag)

# Unresolved questions
[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

#### What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?
- How transcoders should signal LHLS and the format of an LHLS manifest
- .ts or .fmp4 support (or both)
- Handling of trickier features (e.g. discontinuities)
- How to track bitrate for ABR
- How to catch up to the live edge after falling behind

#### What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?
-
#### What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?
- CMAF low latency segments


1. Intent to Implement: Low-Latency Hls.js
2. Demystifying Low-Latency Hls(.js)
3. The Way Things Work: Low-Latency Hls(.js)

There's been a lot of talk about low-latency HLS, but what does an MSE-based client do to make it work? In this talk, I'll walk through how Hls.js streams data through its transmuxing pipeline in order to achieve the lowest latency possible. I'll also be discussing the ongoing LHLS standardization efforts and how your transcoder can work with (L)Hls.js.
